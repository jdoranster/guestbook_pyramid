Pyramid appengine Guestbook aka unomas

This is a mashup of the Google Appengine Gues=tbook example program https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-guestbook-python with the Pyramid appengine https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_appengine.

Some expectations about how this code is setup:

1. Runs in a virtualenv
2. Runs buildout & bootstrap.py as described in the pyramid_appengine page.
3. Tests are run via ../../bin/python setup.py test 
4. buildout is your friend to upate parts/ from src/ when files are added.
